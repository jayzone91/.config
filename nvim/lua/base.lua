A buffer is not written if it becomes hidden, e.g. when 'bufhidden' is
set to "hide" and :next is used.
Note that for some commands the 'autowrite' option is not used, see
'autowriteall' for that.
Some buffers will not be written, specifically when 'buftype' is
"nowrite", "nofile", "terminal" or "prompt".
USE WITH CARE: If you make temporary changes to a buffer that you
don't want to be saved this option may cause it to be saved anyway.
Renaming the buffer with ":file {name}" may help avoid this.

This option helps to avoid all the hit-enter prompts caused by file

		message for reading a file (useful for ":wn" or when
		'autowrite' on)
	  O	message for reading a file overwrites any previous	shm-O
		message;  also for quickfix message (e.g., ":cn")
	  s	don't give "search hit BOTTOM, continuing at TOP" or	shm-s
		"search hit TOP, continuing at BOTTOM" messages; when using
		the search count do not show "W" after the count message (see
		S below)
	  t	truncate file message at the start if it is too long	shm-t
		to fit on the command-line, "<" will appear in the left most
		column; ignored in Ex mode
	  T	truncate other messages in the middle if they are too	shm-T
		long to fit on the command line; "..." will appear in the
		middle; ignored in Ex mode
	  W	don't give "written" or "[w]" when writing a file	shm-W
	  A	don't give the "ATTENTION" message when an existing	shm-A
		swap file is found
	  I	don't give the intro message when starting Vim,		shm-I
		see :intro
	  c	don't give ins-completion-menu messages; for		shm-c
		example, "-- XXX completion (YYY)", "match 1 of 2", "The only
		match", "Pattern not found", "Back at original", etc.
	  C	don't give messages while scanning for ins-completion	shm-C
		items, for instance "scanning tags"

		:silent was used for the command
	  S	do not show search count message when searching, e.g.	shm-S
		"[1/5]"
	This gives you the opportunity to avoid that a change between buffers
	requires you to hit <Enter>, but still gives as useful a message as
	possible for the space available.  To get the whole message that you
	would have got with 'shm' empty, use ":file!"
	Useful values:
	    shm=	No abbreviation of message.
	    shm=a	Abbreviation, but no loss of information.
	    shm=at	Abbreviation, and truncate message when necessary.
